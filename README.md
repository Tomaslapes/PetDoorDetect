<h1>DogDetect</h1>
 
Goal for this project was to create a system that would alert me through whatsapp that my dog, or cat is waiting for me to let it in.

Plan:
- ðŸš§ Collect data [STILL IN PROGRESS - the more the better] 
- âœ… Come up with an architecture
- âœ… Create/come up with a dataloader, data-augmentation
- âœ… Train the network
- ðŸš§ Send message when cat/dog is present
